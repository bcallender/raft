Implemented RPC as JSON messages deserialized to classes (RequestVoteMessage/AppendEntriesMessage) -- Refactored Node to include BrokerManager, pushed out timers to ElectionTimeoutHandler and HeartbeatSender

Non Leader protocol --

CLIENT --> FOLLOWER ---> LEADER ---> FOLLOWER --> CLIENT

Things that we still have to do:

Leader elections
Passing around Append_Entries/Request Vote messages
State transitions across LEADER/FOLLOWER/CANDIDATE
Forwarding messages from followers to leader

Issues -- Concurrent timeouts and sending on the socket.
